This is a restricted government website for official court business only. All activities of CM/ECF subscribers or users of this system for any purpose, and all access attempts, may be recorded and monitored by persons authorized by the federal judiciary for improper use, protection of system security, performance of maintenance and for appropriate management by the judiciary of its systems. By subscribing to CM/ECF, users expressly consent to system monitoring and to official access to data reviewed and created by them on the system. If evidence of unlawful activity is discovered, including unauthorized access attempts, it may be reported to law enforcement officials.

<B>Unauthorized Access to Sealed and Fee Exempt PACER Documents</B></font>
</CENTER>

<p><font color=blue align=left> Sharing your CM/ECF and PACER account credentials (such as logins and passwords) with a third-party service provider or designating such a provider to receive a Notice of Electronic Filing in your cases, gives the provider access to sealed case information and documents in violation of court order.  You are urged to use caution in your computer security practices to ensure sealed documents to which you have access are not disclosed.  Unless expressly authorized by the court, users exempt from PACER fees should not share documents obtained from PACER under the exemption.</font></p>

<HR>
Attention: The court would like to make CM/ECF filers aware of certain security concerns relating to a
software application or .plug-in. called RECAP, which was designed by a group from Princeton
University to enable the sharing of court documents on the Internet.
<br>
<br>
Once a user loads RECAP, documents that he or she subsequently accesses via PACER are
automatically sent to a public Internet repository. Other RECAP/PACER users are then able to
see whether documents are available from the Internet repository. RECAP captures District and
Bankruptcy Court documents, but has not yet incorporated Appellate Court functionality. At this
time, RECAP does not appear to provide users with access to restricted or sealed documents.
Please be aware that RECAP is "open-source" software, which can be freely obtained by anyone
with Internet access and modified for benign or malicious purposes, such as facilitating
unauthorized access to restricted or sealed documents. Accordingly, CM/ECF filers are
reminded to be diligent about their computer security practices to ensure that documents are not
inadvertently shared or compromised.
<br>
<br>
The court and the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts will continue to analyze the
implications of RECAP or related-software and advise you of any ongoing or further concerns.
