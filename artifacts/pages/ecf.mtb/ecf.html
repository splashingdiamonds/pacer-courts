<CENTER><FONT SIZE="5" color=black><B>Pursuant to Mont. LBR 4004-1, motions for entry of discharge are required in Chapter 12 and 13 cases. Historically, these motions have not included a notice and objection period, and the Court has handled these motions inconsistently. Sometimes, these motions have been granted without notice; at other times, the Court has held the motion for 14 days. To resolve this inconsistent approach, the Court has modified docket events to include a notice and objection period. As a result, motions for entry of discharge should include a Notice of Opportunity to Respond and Request a Hearing pursuant to Mont. LBR 9013-1(e).</CENTER></B></FONT>-->

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="4" color=black><B>Effective May 2, 2022, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Montana will require parties requesting summonses to include “Issued to:” and the name of the person or entity being summoned. National forms B2500A Summons in an Adversary Proceeding, and B2500D Third-Party Summons have been modified to accommodate this change. They are available on the court’s website on the local forms page at <a href=" https://www.mtb.uscourts.gov/local-forms">https://www.mtb.uscourts.gov/local-forms</a>. 
<BR>
Parties may start using the modified forms immediately. They will be required on or after May 2, 2022.</CENTER></B></FONT
